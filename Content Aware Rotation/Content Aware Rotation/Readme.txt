1. The iPython Notebook named as CAR has the initial part of the code implemented so far. 
	(Note that CAR.py and CAR.ipynb are simply the same).
	(If one wants to run it through the terminal, kindly proceed as
	python3 CAR.py, from the directory, or
	python CAR.py, from the directory respectively depending on the 
	default installation of Python)
2. Note that the iPython Notebook has not been linked with the Programs written in the 
Codes directory. There is a main() in the Codes directory, which'll be the main function for the final phase of the project.
2. The datasets here were directly obtained from the website of the first author of the paper Kaiming He. The dataset that will be used in the final project presentation would be the same from the current dataset attached. This dataset has the initial angle of rotation, which is a neccessity for the entire algorithm to run. These angles have been stored in the file RotationAngles.txt in the folder Dataset.
3. The Folder containing codes has a part of the code implemented thus far. This is because of the fact that the energy optimization has not been done so far due to various issues that I faced during the course of my project. My final phase of the project would have all of these codes implemented successfully. 
4. For now, the only working piece of code is the iPython Notebook. The Python Version under use is 3.6.6. I have used OpenCV 3.4.3.
