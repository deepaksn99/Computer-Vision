1. This is an incomplete code of my implementation of the Course Project. 

The following files have correct code written
1. shape_matrix.py
2. line_matrix.py
3. Energyfunction.py - This is to just compute the total energy. This is complete
			except for the Boundary Constraints, for which the code has still
			not been written as the matrix to be found is something that I am 
			still working on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. optimization.py consists of the general structure of the optimization part of the code. This is also still a work in progress. This part of the code will be complete once the matrices for Pk, and boundary constraints are found.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. pk.py is an almost empty file that will eventually consist of my implementation for the decomposition
	of the matrix ek into Pk and V. 
5. main() as of now is not complete. I have just imported standard functions and the rest of the function will be completed in due course.
6. meshgrid.py is also incomplete as of now. I have just written the functions to be filled.
