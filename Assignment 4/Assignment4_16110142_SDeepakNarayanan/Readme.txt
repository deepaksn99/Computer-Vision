---------------------------------------- NOTES --------------------------------------
1. Python Version under use is 3.6.6 (Default Installation => No need of python3 in executing the script).
2. Please make sure that both OpenCV as well as OpenCV contrib version 3.4.2.18 are available. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Execution of the Script
-----------------------
1. From terminal execute the following command:
   python Assignment4_16110142.py.
-----------------------

Expected Output
-----------------------
1. The resized input data size is stored in the same folder of execution of the script as Reference.jpg and 
Source.jpg. 
2. The final output image is stored in Results folder under the name Result.jpg
-----------------------

The default run of the code is for the images in the folder Dataset having Vintage in their names. 

-----------------------
Results Obtained contain all the results that I obtained while running the code. 
Datasets has all the datasets used. 
Mask.jpg was the result obtained without any resizing. The Reference Images can be thus found both in the Dataset Resized and Dataset Folders.

-----------------------
I have done a test run of the program and the respective files are present. 
----------------------

Also, the TAs are kindly requested to resize the Image appropriately to get the 
needed output.

Intial Part of the code was majorly referred from
https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/da/de9/tutorial_py_epipolar_geometry.html
